Pandemic PGRs is a grassroots collective which formed in response to the inadequate support measures that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. From conducting research and advocacy in support of ‘blanket funded extensions’ to fostering a culture of organising within PGR communities, Pandemic PGRs aim to support all PGRs who are working in the UK HE institutions. The group has a close working relationship with UCU and other grassroots groups in the sector fighting precarity and marginalisation, and practices a non-hierarchical form of organising based around consensus.
