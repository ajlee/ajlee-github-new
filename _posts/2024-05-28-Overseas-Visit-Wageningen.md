I have just returned from a three month trip to Wageningen University in the Netherlands. I was invited by Bram Büscher and was located in the Sociology of Development and Change group. This period of three months was one of the best times in my PhD. Not only was I located in a lovely town, but I also made good contacts with researchers who are internationally respected, got my research more widely known, attended some great seminars, and now co-writing a paper with someone I met there. I also made some great friends. In this blog I will say more about this visit, and why everyone funded by the SCDTP should consider applying for an OIV.

Wageningen University is a big university in a small town. There are 13,000 students and 7,600 staff members, while the town is only 40,000 people, meaning the university is a major part of the local community. The university is primarily focused on natural sciences, but is also a global player in areas such as advanced food technology, AI farming, biodiversity economics, entrepreneurship and climate science. It claims to be the “most sustainable university in the world” and has partnerships with many global corporations, such as Unilever, who in 2019 located their Food Innovation Center on campus, International Flavours and Fragrances, another major international food company, and there is even a dairy science research centre on site. The university has had enormous growth in the last 15 years as large corporations have increasingly invested in research partnerships with the university. Co-incidentally, I also had the chance to visit a fantastic exhibition at the Maritime Museum called Food for Thought, that highlighted many problems with corporate food systems, and asked questions about how sustainable they can be. 

 
I was located in the Sociology of Development and Change group, which is a leading voice in critical research. However, they also are trying to respond to assumptions that critical research does not provide practical outputs. One example of this is the setting up of the Convivial Conservation organisation, which has a framework to encourage and support real-world examples of alternative ways of conserving nature in a socially just way, providing an alternative to typical capitalist solutions. Bram Büscher and Robert Fletcher are two highly respected academics working in SDC, who in 2020 published The Conservation Revolution. This outlines their vision for these alternatives, and has created an international movement, for example, encouraging projects to move away from militarized “protected areas” that aim to save nature by fencing out humans, to “promoted areas” that do not, and instead encourage people to visit and interact with non-human nature.

Within SDC I met people researching conservation politics around elephant corridors in India, tourism in Indonesia, alternative ways of valuing nature in the Alps, bird hunting trips in Malta, and housing issues in South America. I met people who were researching with Rewilding Europe and Ark, who are major voices in European conservation, heard presentations and discussions on Western forms of anthropology in the Global South, on the importance of acknowledging emotions and mistakes in research, post-human approaches to conservation, and politics of extinction. Possibly the most interesting was from Esther Turnhout, in science and technology studies, who gave a fascinating talk about how dominant knowledge systems tend to reproduce themselves.

The benefits to my research should not be underestimated. As part of this visit, I presented my research on the politics of rewilding in the UK, and this generated a lot of interest. As a result, when I publish articles on this subject, I know there is a network of interested researchers who will be keen to read it. It also means that I have a network of people researching into similar areas. In the University of Brighton, those researching conservation politics are few in number. Having this network could potentially change my career. For example, because of a chance conversation, I am now co-authoring a paper on rewilding and convivial conservation, two hot topics in research, which I hope will generate significant interest in the community. I know other people researching into this area, so there are possibilities for other partnerships in future. I have more awareness too of the possibilities of research funding available in the EU, which may be something I can look into after my PhD finishes. Just before I visited the Netherlands, I had a call with an experienced academic as part of the British Sociology Association’s mentoring programme. One piece of advice was to build an academic network. If you have this network you’ll be “lucky” more often, because you’ll hear about projects, job vacancies, conferences, and far more opportunities for interesting partnerships with other researchers. I think I am well on the way to building my network now.

Of course, I also got opportunities to travel around the Netherlands in my free time. The Netherlands has some great places to visit - historic cities, wonderful architecture, and great cycling and walking routes. The birdlife in Wageningen was great, and in one place I stayed I would watch jays building nests in the garden and heard nightingales and black caps in the park. A nearby wetland has birds such as black -tailed godwits. However, the favourite place I visited was Schoorl, which is next to the largest area of sand dunes in the Netherlands, and is a wonderful place to explore.

This was funded by the Overseas Institutional Visit fund that SCDTP has, which is open to anyone to apply for as long as they are not within the last three months of funding. I was not really aware of the funding for overseas visits until a friend mentioned this during a conversation. While it had probably been emailed to me by SCDTP, for some reason I didn’t really think it would be useful and so never looked into what it actually was. I am glad I did look into this, as it ended up being one of the best parts of my PhD, and very useful in terms of building a successful career. If you think your academic network could be improved, I would definitely look into an Overseas Institutional Visit. I don't know if other funders do this but I would highly recommend finding out!
