## Casual Teaching

I live in Darlington and am open to the possibility of teaching casual sessions at universities in the region. I have taught philosophy and criminology, and would be open to teaching in geography and social science depending on the module. I would also be interested in teaching in computing since I worked for a long time in this area.  

## Drupal Services

Previous to my PhD, I worked in IT for many years, and can still provide some freelance services.
I have supported a number of clients with Drupal website development. Drupal is very flexible but is generally suited to medium to large sized projects. I worked with Friends of the Earth (England Wales and Northern Ireland), Friends of the Earth Europe, First Class Holidays, DR Agency, and Good Food Greater Manchester. Currently not looking for work in this area but post-PhD I may be interested. 

## Microsites

While Drupal is great for bigger projects, I am also interested in creating minimalist microsites such as this. I also created the site for (pgrs.uk)[http://pgrs.uk]. Both of these sites use Jekyll because they require no database, they are hosted free on Github. I would be happy to provide other academics with personal microsites for reasonable fees, so please get in touch if you are interested.

## E-Learning Content

Prior to working on Drupal sites, I worked as in e-learning, and for six years I worked with both Blackboard and Moodle systems for Manchester Metropolitan University. I supported staff and students in creating content, created guides and documentation, and developed widgets displaying calendars, assignment deadlines, and reading lists. As a freelancer, I created Apple e-book content for one course at MMU, and created e-learning courses for Campaign for Learning. 

## General IT Support

I have also on occasion provided general IT support and training. I currently do occasional work for Vegetarian for Life maintaining their computers, databases, backups, and providing general advice. 

## Proofreading

While I do not provide proofreading services, I can recommend Liz Ottosson of (Better World Words)[https://betterworldwords.com/] who will do a fabulous job for you! She has been working in proofreading and translation for over twenty years. I am biased though since she is my partner!
